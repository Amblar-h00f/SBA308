// objectives:
//Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately
//Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
//use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
//develope functions to create reusable code.
//utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections
//implement error handling to manage potentional code failures gracefully.
/*Requiremets:
Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate.
Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals
Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables.
Use at least two if/else statements to control program flow. Optionally, use at least one switch statement
Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.
Utilize at least two different types of loops.
Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue
Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects
Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object
Use functions to handle repeated tasks
Program outputs processed data as described above. Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence to the described behavior.
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
Commit frequently to the git repository.
Include a README file that contains a description of your application.*/
