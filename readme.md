What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
Having more of a systematic process for implementation
Also a great deal more practice 


Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
The process of learning javascript is over-whelming. Learning the initial steps just to find out there is a shortened code structure to the objective. 
I tend to put into words the code I'm looking at, Reading to myself like its a page in a book. I'm not sure if this method is helping me to fully understand javascript implementation. 


What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
I am currently utilizing other coding projects online. I did struggle with javascript and found it to be anxiety inducing. lol
